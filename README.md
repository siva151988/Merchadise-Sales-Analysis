#### Project Insights
- The **monthly revenue trend** shows a steady decline from **$81K in May 2024 to $10K in November 2024**.While the total sales are significant ($856.46K), this downward trend may suggest seasonal effects or reduced marketing effectiveness in later months.
- **Clothing** is the top-performing category, contributing **74.4% of total revenue**.**Ornaments** follow at **18.1%**, and **Other products** account for only **7.41%.Customer** distribution also supports this: **50.09% of customers purchased Clothing**.
- Top products (by revenue and units sold):
  - Product ID **BF1548, BF1543, and BF1549** under the Clothing category each generated **over $140K in revenue**.
  - Products like **BF1555 and BF1553** (under "Other") generated **less than $10K**, indicating low customer interest.
- **Sydney ($48K)**, followed by **San Francisco ($41K)** and **New Jersey ($40K)**.Sales spread across **North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia**, as shown in the map visualization. Domestic vs. International sales split is nearly even:
    - International: $469.61K (54.83%)
    - Domestic: $386.86K (45.17%)
- International sales **outperform domestic**, with a **54.83% share**.
- The buyer demographic leans **young(25-30 yrs) and male (70%)**, typical for e-commerce retail in fashion categories.
- **5-Star** products generate **$259K**, while **4-Star** rated products closely follow at **$256K**.Poorly rated products (2-Star) contribute just **$59K**,highlighting a **positive correlation between rating and sales performance**.
- Customers are more concentrated in regions with lower or moderate shipping fees, possibly influencing purchase decisions.
- Drop in revenue toward year-end (despite steady orders) could imply price reductions or discounts.
- Same products **(e.g., BF1543, BF1548)** appear multiple times.Combined with high ratings and consistent demand, these are likely repeat purchases, especially in Clothing.

#### Final Outcome
The Merchandise Sales Dashboard effectively consolidates performance data across product, region, demographic, and rating dimensions. Key takeaways include:
- Clothing dominates sales, backed by high ratings and global demand.
- International shipping broadens reach, contributing more than 50% of revenue.
- Young male buyers (25â€“30) are the dominant demographic.
- Sales are positively influenced by higher ratings, repeat purchases, and accessible shipping.

This dashboard empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions on product strategy, customer targeting, and regional expansion, with clear opportunities for improving underperforming products and customer segments.
